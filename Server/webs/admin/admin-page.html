		Adds a light to the server, and optionally a client. To add/create a
		completely new light one needs a name, client, client IP and pin numbers
		for each of the light's color channels. If a PWM pin is already in use,
		or if the generated ID is already taken, the operation will fail.
		To add a light to the server that already exists on a client, then
		one needs the ID of the light, as well as the client's name and IP.
		In either case, the server must already be aware of the client.
