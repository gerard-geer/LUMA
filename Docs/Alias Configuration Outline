The Aliases configuration file is simply a lookup table pairing client names and
(static) IP addresses.

The server looks at what light an update is for, sees which client that light
is on, looks up that client's IP and sends it out.

Example object:

{
	. . .
	<client name>: <client IP address>,
	. . .
}
